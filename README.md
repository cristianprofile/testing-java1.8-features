Testing java 1.8 : I Love functional programming
========================

Testing java 1.8 new features with dates and lambda expression using collections streams.

-  Filter a collection with lambda expression using boolean predicate
-  Reuse predicates with and or and not logical operator
-  Use any and all operator to streams (boolean operation)
-  Use max and min comparator with stream and testing  new optional object, null pointer has death
-  Created lambda function declaration to be reused (Lambda function, lambda int function)
-  Use mapToInt and Map to double to test sum and average calculation operation
